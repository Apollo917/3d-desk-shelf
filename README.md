# Desk Shelf

A 3D-printable modular and extendable desk shelf system, designed to organize your workspace and expand with
accessories.

This project was designed in **Autodesk Fusion** and the repository includes both the **Fusion project files** and
**.3mf files** preconfigured for the **Bambu Lab P1S** 3D printer.

**Dimensions:**

- **Height:** 150mm
- **Width:** depends on the tube length you choose
- ⚠️ Keep in mind that some accessories, or certain ways of using them, may require additional vertical space - consider
  this when positioning the shelf

**Required materials:**

- ~460g of PLA filament
- 4-5 tubes with a 13.1 mm outer diameter
- 2 M4 40mm screws
    - The length depends on your desk thickness
    - Shelf mounts require at least 10 mm of thread engagement to be fully secured
    - You have up to 10 mm of extra space to “hide” additional screw length

## Main parts

- **Filament required:** ~8.5g
- **Installation:**
    - Choose the desired position for your shelf
    - Drill holes for M4 screws, and secure the mounts with M4 screws
    - ⚠️ When marking the holes, keep in mind that each screw hole should be positioned **49 mm behind the front edge of
      the side stand** - this ensures that the shelf will sit exactly where you want it on your desk
