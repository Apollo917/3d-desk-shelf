# Shelf mounts

Provide stable mounting points for the desk shelf and enable quick and easy installation

- **Filament required:** ~8.5g
- **Installation:**
    - Choose the desired position for your shelf
    - Drill holes for M4 screws, and secure the mounts with M4 screws
    - ⚠️ When marking the holes, keep in mind that each screw hole should be positioned **49 mm behind the front edge of
      the side stand** - this ensures that the shelf will sit exactly where you want it on your desk
